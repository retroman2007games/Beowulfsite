        <h3>👹 Grendel</h3>
        <p>The terrifying demon that hates the sound of woship. He bears sea-like features, can kill humans with one hand, and is suprisingly swift for his size. He haunted Herot for years, it wasn’t until the victory of our hero, Beowulf, that Herot’s torment came to an end. </p>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>💀 Grendel’s Mother</h3>
        <p>The only thing scarier than a sea monster is, unironically, a sea monster’s mother. She doesn’t play fair and drags heroes into her underwater lair, where they meet a gruesome end..</p>

      <div class="event">

      <h2>📜 Anglo-Saxon History</h2>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>🏰 Origins of the Anglo-Saxons</h3>
        <p>The Anglo-Saxons were a group of Germanic tribes — the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes — who migrated to Britain after the fall of the Roman Empire. They settled across what is now England, building villages, mead halls, and strong fortifications.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>⚔️ Warrior Culture</h3>
        <p>Anglo-Saxon society highly valued bravery, honor, and loyalty. Warriors swore oaths to their kings, fought monsters (real and legendary), and sought glory in battle. Poets often celebrated these heroes in epic stories — just like <strong>Beowulf</strong>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>🏛️ Mead Halls and Daily Life</h3>
        <p>The mead hall was the social heart of Anglo-Saxon life — a place for feasting, storytelling, and planning battles. Farmers, craftsmen, and warriors all gathered there to celebrate victories and bond as a community. Mead flowed freely while bards recited heroic tales.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>🛡️ Law and Kingship</h3>
        <p>Kings ruled with a mix of loyalty, wisdom, and strength. Anglo-Saxon law emphasized fairness, compensation for wrongs, and protection of the community. Kings rewarded their warriors with treasures, land, or symbolic gifts — building bonds that were as important as swords in battle.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>📜 Language and Literature</h3>
        <p>Old English was the language of the Anglo-Saxons. Epic poems like <strong>Beowulf</strong> were passed down orally for generations before being written. Poetry often used alliteration, kennings, and rhythm to make stories easier to remember and more dramatic in performance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>🌾 Society and Beliefs</h3>
        <p>The Anglo-Saxons were farmers, hunters, and skilled craftsmen. Their beliefs mixed pagan traditions with the later influence of Christianity, which began spreading across England in the 7th century. Monsters, dragons, and fate (“wyrd”) were common themes in both stories and daily life.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h3>⚔️ Legacy</h3>
        <p>The Anglo-Saxons left a lasting mark on England: language, laws, art, and literature. Epic tales like Beowulf continue to inspire stories of heroism and adventure, bridging the gap between their world and ours — a world full of monsters, kings, and brave warriors.</p>
